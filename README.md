Anchored News is a platform that aims to revolutionize the way we consume news. Through innovative data visualization techniques and engaging user interfaces, Anchored News helps users discover global news, trends, and media bias in a whole new way. Unreleased, Anchored News is constantly being developed to integrate live news publications with maps and graphs to provide users with the most up-to-date information.

## Background

Anchored News is a bachelor-level project in front-end website development and interactive design. As the creator, I am driven by a desire to tackle the challenges of big-data retrieval and information retention in the digital age. My designerly intentions are centered around providing users with freedom and personalization, creating a space for curiosity to thrive.

I acknowledge that bias is an inherent aspect of news content. That's why I've designed Anchored News to allow for bias to occur in search query and interaction, while still providing users with a diverse, meaningful, and accessible resource.
